# UI — UI Toolkit, design tokens, data binding, MVP

UI Toolkit is the UI system: menus, HUD, data-heavy screens, and world-space.
It is retained-mode, renders textureless through a dynamic atlas, and receives
Unity's UI investment.

## Animated UI

Animate with **USS transitions** for state changes, and drive anything more
elaborate from C# against the visual tree.

Native keyframe animation for UI Toolkit — authored in the standard Animation
window, with clips playing on a `VisualElement` without an Animator component —
targets **6.7 LTS**, and is experimental behind a feature flag in 6.6. Treat 6.6
as evaluation only. Animator Controller parity (parameters, transitions, blend
trees) and Timeline track integration are not committed, so design animated UI
around clips and USS transitions rather than a state machine.

## Panel Renderer

Panel Renderer (6.5) binds a UXML document to a GameObject and is what makes
world-space UI native. `UIDocument` remains valid for screen-space overlays.

- Add via `GameObject → UI Toolkit → Panel Renderer`; configure Panel Settings, Source Asset, Sort Order, and World-Space Dimensions.
- World-space needs `Render Mode → World Space` on the Panel Settings asset, plus Pixels Per Unit (100 by default).
- Size modes: **Dynamic** derives size from explicitly sized content; **Fixed** takes a manual container size and suits content that flexes.
- Interaction requires a Panel Input Configuration — event cameras, interaction layers, maximum interaction distance.
- World-space root panels sort by camera distance first; Sort Order breaks ties among nested and sibling panels.
- 2D sorting layers do not apply to world-space panels in 6.5. Order diegetic UI by camera distance.

## Design tokens

- Declare every visual constant as a USS variable in one tokens file: `--color-primary`, `--space-2`, `--font-size-body`.
- Compose tokens into theme style sheets: import the default theme (`@import url("unity-theme://default")`), override per theme, and swap the TSS at runtime to change themes.
- Reference tokens from element styles, so a value changes in one place.
- Let UI authors own UXML and USS in UI Builder; keep layout out of C#.
- Reach for USS filters (blur, grayscale, sepia, tint, invert, opacity — 6.3, URP) and UI Shader Graph materials for visual effects, over pre-rendered textures or per-frame C# tinting.

## Showing data

Structure UI as **MVP**: UXML and USS are a passive view, a presenter queries
elements and subscribes to model changes, and models are plain C# or
ScriptableObjects holding no UI references.

- Bind through runtime data binding — `DataBinding`, `[CreateProperty]` on model properties, binding paths set in UI Builder, `ListView` item binding for collections. Bindings sync both ways and replace per-frame assignment in `Update()`.
- Set `dataSource` once on the root element; it propagates to every child, and a child overrides it locally where a subtree binds to different data. Screens that reuse one model type declare the data source *type* and paths in UXML, leaving code a single job: assigning the instance when it changes.
- Pick the narrowest binding mode per control: `ToTarget` for display, `TwoWay` only where the UI writes back, `ToTargetOnce` for set-and-forget values. Reference properties with `nameof(...)` so renames refactor the path.
- Implement `IDataSourceViewHashProvider` and `INotifyBindablePropertyChanged` on every bound model — setters guard on change, bump a version, and raise `propertyChanged`. Without them the binding system re-syncs every frame and boxes every value-type property it copies.
- Keep game logic out of `VisualElement` subclasses, and let gameplay talk to the model rather than querying the visual tree.

## Text

Advanced Text Generator is the default from 6.5 (manually enabled in 6.4) and
cuts text CPU cost. Let it own line-breaking and fitting. Migrate static font
assets to dynamic, which is what it expects. Where a screen needs the old
behaviour, opt that screen out with `-unity-text-generator: standard`.

## Performance

- Virtualize long lists with `ListView` rather than instantiating thousands of elements.
- Toggle USS classes and let transitions animate, rather than writing `style.*` per frame — direct style writes trigger layout and repaint.
- Keep hierarchies shallow and selectors simple on large screens; `:hover`-heavy selectors over long lists are costly. The USS Stats Profiler (Project Settings → UI Toolkit, 6.5) shows per-panel selector cost.
- Route UI input through the Input System UI module, and keep a single input backend active so events fire once.
